This repository is code release of out PRCV 2019 paper (here). In this work, we propose a deep learning based method to segment power line corridor LiDAR point cloud. We design an effective channel presentation for LiDAR point cloud and adapt a point cloud segmentation network ([pointnet](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet)) as our basic network. To verify the generalization ability of our channel presentation, we also do experiments on Kitti dataset and achieve good performance.
