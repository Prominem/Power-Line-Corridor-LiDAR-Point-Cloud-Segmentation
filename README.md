# introduction
This repository is code release of out PRCV 2019 paper (here). In this work, we propose a deep learning based method to segment power line corridor LiDAR point cloud. We design an effective channel presentation for LiDAR point cloud and adapt a point cloud segmentation network ([pointnet](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet)) as our basic network. To verify the generalization ability of our channel presentation, we also do experiments on Kitti dataset. Experiments show that our channel presentation not only works well on Power Line Corridor LiDAR Point Cloud dataset, but also generalizes well on Kitti dataset.<br>
For more details of our method, please refer to our paper.
